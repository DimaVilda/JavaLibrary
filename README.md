# JavaLibrary
An application for library order to automate and simplify the process of accounting.
Me and my friends we wrote a project that helps to automate book management in the library. 
Nothing complicated, just automated bookkeeping)) 
Also in the folder "scannerbarcode" I have implemented classes for scanning books by a barcode reader.
The project is built into a *.jar library and can be used in other similar projects.
